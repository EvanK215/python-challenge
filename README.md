# Intro

In this challenge, We were tasked with creating a Python script for 2 disticnt data sets. **PyBank** and **PyPoll**  analyzing the financial records of a company and electioin results from a recent race. 

## Dependencies 

OS and CSV

## PyBank
[https://github.com/EvanK215/python-challenge/tree/master/PyBank]

### Resourcers 
[PyBank\Resources\budget_data.csv]
the Csv file is a two column file with months and Profit/loss columns

### Application Anwsers  

create a Python script to calculate each of the following

  - The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  - The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

  - The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

Export findings to a  text file stored in [PyBank\analysis\report.txt]

## PyPoll

### Resourcers 
[PyPoll\Resources\election_data.csv]
the CSV file is a three column election results file with voter/voter county and candidate voted for

### Application Anwsers
